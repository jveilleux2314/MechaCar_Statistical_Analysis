## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Based on our P values from our prediction statistics - there are multple coefficients that drastically effect our mpg on the prototypes. Intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance all statistically effect our mpg.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

## Individually the manufacturing variance does not meet design specifications because Lot 3 exceeds the 100 lbs per square inch.

## All manufacturing lots together meet a variance of 62.29. Therefore meeting specifications.
